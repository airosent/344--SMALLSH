# 344--SMALLSH
Repository for CS 344 project SMALLSH

To compile my program, please use the following command...

"`gcc -g -Wextra -Wall -Wno-unused-parameter -pedantic --std=gnu99 -o smallsh smallsh.c"

This command produces the the required executable called smallsh. 
-g adds debug information to the executable
--std=gnu99 option ensures that the source code complies with the GNU99 standard

In order to start the shell, you execute `./smallsh` in the same directory where you compiled it.

All sources used are included inside the smallsh.c program itself.
